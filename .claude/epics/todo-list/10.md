# Task 009: Deployment Configuration & Production Setup

## Description

Configure the application for production deployment including environment-specific configurations, security hardening, monitoring setup, and deployment automation. Ensure the application is ready for single-server production deployment with proper configuration management.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Production application.yml configuration with environment variables
- [ ] Database configuration for production MySQL setup
- [ ] SSL/HTTPS configuration and security headers
- [ ] Logging configuration for production monitoring
- [ ] Environment-specific property management
- [ ] Production build optimization and packaging
- [ ] Health check endpoints for monitoring
- [ ] Graceful application shutdown handling
- [ ] Error handling and reporting for production
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures documented

## Technical Implementation Details

### Environment Configuration
- **Profile Management**: Separate profiles for development, testing, production
- **Environment Variables**: Externalized configuration for sensitive data
- **Property Encryption**: Encrypted properties for production secrets
- **Configuration Validation**: Startup validation for required configuration
- **Feature Flags**: Environment-specific feature toggles if needed

### Production Security
- **HTTPS Configuration**: SSL certificate setup and HTTP to HTTPS redirection
- **Security Headers**: Production-hardened security header configuration
- **Database Security**: Production database credentials and connection security
- **Session Security**: Production session configuration with secure cookies
- **Audit Logging**: Security event logging for production monitoring

### Deployment Packaging
- **Maven Build**: Production build profile with optimizations
- **JAR Packaging**: Executable JAR with embedded Tomcat
- **Docker Configuration**: Containerization for consistent deployment (optional)
- **Startup Scripts**: Service startup and management scripts
- **Resource Configuration**: Memory and JVM settings for production

### Monitoring and Logging
- **Application Logging**: Structured logging with appropriate log levels
- **Health Endpoints**: Spring Boot Actuator health checks
- **Metrics Collection**: Basic application metrics and monitoring
- **Error Tracking**: Centralized error logging and alerting
- **Performance Monitoring**: Basic performance metric collection

### Backup and Recovery
- **Database Backup**: Automated database backup procedures
- **Application Data**: User data backup and recovery procedures
- **Configuration Backup**: Application configuration backup
- **Recovery Testing**: Backup restoration testing procedures
- **Disaster Recovery**: Basic disaster recovery planning

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Production configuration testing in staging environment
- [ ] SSL/HTTPS configuration validation
- [ ] Performance testing with production-like configuration
- [ ] Security testing with production security settings
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedure testing
- [ ] Health check endpoint validation
- [ ] Load testing with production deployment configuration
- [ ] Environment variable and configuration validation

## Definition of Done

- Application successfully deployable to production environment
- All production configurations tested and validated
- Security hardening implemented and verified
- Monitoring and logging functional in production
- Backup and recovery procedures tested and documented
- Deployment process documented and repeatable
- Production readiness checklist completed
