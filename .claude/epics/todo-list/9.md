# Task 008: Performance Optimization

## Description

Optimize application performance to meet specified benchmarks including page load times under 2 seconds, database query response times under 500ms, and support for 100+ concurrent users. Implement caching strategies, database optimization, and frontend performance improvements.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Page load times consistently under 2 seconds for all major pages
- [ ] Database queries optimized to execute in under 500ms
- [ ] Application supports 100+ concurrent users without degradation
- [ ] Database indexing strategy implemented for optimal query performance
- [ ] Frontend asset optimization (minification, compression, caching)
- [ ] Database connection pooling optimized for concurrent access
- [ ] Query optimization for complex filtering and sorting operations
- [ ] Memory usage optimization to prevent memory leaks
- [ ] Monitoring and logging setup for performance tracking
- [ ] Performance benchmarks documented and validated

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Optimization
- **Index Strategy**: Composite indexes for user_id + created_at, user_id + due_date, user_id + priority
- **Query Optimization**: Analyze and optimize slow queries using EXPLAIN
- **Connection Pooling**: HikariCP configuration for optimal connection management
- **Pagination**: Efficient pagination implementation for large result sets
- **Query Caching**: MyBatis query result caching for frequently accessed data

### Frontend Performance
- **Asset Optimization**: Minification and compression of CSS/JavaScript
- **Lazy Loading**: Defer loading of non-critical resources
- **Browser Caching**: Proper cache headers for static resources
- **Image Optimization**: Compress and optimize images for web delivery
- **Critical Path**: Optimize critical rendering path for faster initial page load

### Application Performance
- **JVM Tuning**: Optimal JVM settings for memory and garbage collection
- **Session Management**: Efficient session storage and cleanup
- **Response Caching**: HTTP response caching for static content
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Non-blocking operations where appropriate
- **Resource Management**: Proper resource cleanup and connection management

### Monitoring and Profiling
- **Performance Metrics**: Application monitoring with key performance indicators
- **Database Monitoring**: Query performance tracking and slow query logging
- **Memory Profiling**: Memory usage analysis and leak detection
- **Load Testing**: Regular performance testing under realistic conditions
- **Performance Baseline**: Establish performance benchmarks and regression detection

### Caching Strategy
- **Application Caching**: In-memory caching for frequently accessed data
- **Database Caching**: Query result caching at database level
- **Browser Caching**: Client-side caching for static resources
- **CDN Strategy**: Content delivery optimization (if applicable)
- **Cache Invalidation**: Proper cache invalidation strategies

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Performance benchmarking tests for all major user workflows
- [ ] Load testing with 100+ concurrent users simulation
- [ ] Database performance testing with large datasets
- [ ] Memory leak testing with extended runtime scenarios
- [ ] Page load time testing across different network conditions
- [ ] Mobile performance testing on various device capabilities
- [ ] Stress testing to identify performance breaking points
- [ ] Regression testing to ensure optimizations don't break functionality
