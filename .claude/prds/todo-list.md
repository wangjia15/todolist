# PRD: todo-list

## Executive Summary

A modern, multi-user todo list management system that enables users to create, organize, and track personal tasks through a secure, responsive web interface. The system emphasizes user isolation, data security, and intuitive task management workflows while maintaining a minimal viable product (MVP) approach.

**Value Proposition**: Provide individuals with a reliable, secure platform to manage personal tasks with complete data privacy and an excellent user experience across devices.

## Problem Statement

### What problem are we solving?
Many individuals struggle with task organization and productivity due to:
- Scattered task management across multiple platforms
- Lack of secure, personal task storage
- Poor user experience in existing solutions
- Complex interfaces that hinder rather than help productivity
- Concerns about data privacy in cloud-based solutions

### Why is this important now?
- Remote work has increased the need for personal productivity tools
- Users demand simple, fast, and reliable task management
- Data privacy concerns require user isolation and secure authentication
- Mobile-first design is essential for modern productivity workflows
