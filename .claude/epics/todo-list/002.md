# Task 002: User Authentication System Implementation

## Description

Implement secure user authentication system using Spring Security with session-based authentication, user registration, login/logout functionality, and password security. This system ensures complete user data isolation and secure access to the application.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] User registration endpoint with email validation and password strength requirements
- [ ] Secure login functionality with session management
- [ ] Logout functionality with complete session invalidation
- [ ] Password hashing using BCrypt algorithm
- [ ] Session timeout configuration and management
- [ ] Login/logout pages with proper form validation
- [ ] Authentication guards preventing unauthorized access to user areas
- [ ] Email uniqueness validation during registration
- [ ] Proper error handling for authentication failures
- [ ] Redirect logic for authenticated/unauthenticated users

## Technical Implementation Details

### Spring Security Configuration
- **Security Configuration**: Session-based authentication (not JWT)
- **Password Encoding**: BCrypt with appropriate strength factor
- **Session Management**: Secure session configuration with timeout
- **CSRF Protection**: Enabled for form submissions
- **HTTP Security**: Proper URL pattern protection

### Controller Endpoints
- **AuthController**: Registration, login, logout endpoints
- **Form Validation**: Server-side validation with proper error messages
- **Error Handling**: Custom error pages and validation feedback
- **Redirect Logic**: Post-login redirects and access control

### Service Layer
- **UserService**: User creation, validation, and authentication logic
- **Password Management**: Secure password hashing and verification
- **User Repository**: Data access layer for user operations
- **Session Management**: User session handling and security

### Security Features
- **Input Validation**: Email format, password strength, XSS prevention
- **SQL Injection Protection**: Parameterized queries through MyBatis-Plus
- **Session Security**: Secure cookie configuration and session fixation protection
- **Rate Limiting**: Basic protection against brute force attacks

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Unit tests for UserService authentication methods
- [ ] Integration tests for login/logout flow
- [ ] Security tests for unauthorized access attempts
- [ ] Validation tests for registration form inputs
- [ ] Session management tests (timeout, invalidation)
- [ ] Password hashing and verification tests
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility tests for authentication forms
- [ ] Performance tests for authentication operations

## Definition of Done

- Complete authentication system fully functional
- All security requirements implemented and tested
- User registration and login working across browsers
- Session management properly configured
- All authentication-related tests passing
- Security vulnerabilities assessed and mitigated
- Documentation updated with authentication flow
