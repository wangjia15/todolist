# Task 001: Database Schema & Configuration Setup

## Description

Establish the foundational database infrastructure for the todo-list application, including MySQL configuration, schema design, and entity relationships. This task creates the core data structure that supports user isolation and task management.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] MySQL database connection configured with proper credentials (localhost:3306, root user)
- [ ] User entity table created with fields: id, email, password_hash, created_at, updated_at
- [ ] Task entity table created with fields: id, user_id, title, description, priority, due_date, completed, created_at, updated_at
- [ ] Foreign key relationship established between tasks and users for data isolation
- [ ] Database indexes created for performance optimization (user_id, created_at, due_date)
- [ ] MyBatis-Plus configuration properly integrated with Spring Boot
- [ ] Database connection pooling configured for concurrent access
- [ ] Database schema validation working correctly
- [ ] All database operations tested with sample data

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema Design
- **Users Table**: Primary key auto-increment, unique email constraint, BCrypt password storage
- **Tasks Table**: Foreign key to users table, soft delete capability, priority enum (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH)
- **Indexing Strategy**: Composite indexes for user_id + created_at, user_id + due_date for efficient querying
- **Data Types**: VARCHAR for strings, DATETIME for timestamps, BOOLEAN for completion status

### Configuration Components
- **application.yml**: Database connection properties, MyBatis configuration
- **DataSource Configuration**: Connection pooling with HikariCP
- **MyBatis-Plus Config**: Entity scanning, SQL logging for development
- **Migration Strategy**: SQL scripts for table creation and initial setup

### Entity Classes
- User entity with proper annotations for validation and mapping
- Task entity with user relationship and field validation
- Proper toString(), equals(), and hashCode() implementations

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Unit tests for entity validation and constraints
- [ ] Integration tests for database connectivity and CRUD operations
- [ ] Test data isolation between different users
- [ ] Performance tests for query execution times (< 500ms target)
- [ ] Test database rollback and transaction handling
- [ ] Verify proper foreign key constraint enforcement

## Definition of Done

- Database schema successfully created and validated
- All entities properly mapped with MyBatis-Plus
- Sample data can be inserted and retrieved without errors
- User data isolation verified through testing
- Database performance meets specified requirements
- Code reviewed and tested thoroughly
