# Task 007: Testing & Quality Assurance

## Description

Implement comprehensive testing strategy including unit tests, integration tests, and quality assurance measures to ensure application reliability, maintainability, and performance. Establish testing frameworks and achieve adequate code coverage across all application layers.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Unit tests for all service layer methods with >80% code coverage
- [ ] Integration tests for all controller endpoints
- [ ] Repository layer tests with database interactions
- [ ] Security testing for authentication and authorization
- [ ] Performance testing for critical user workflows
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility testing
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness testing across device types
- [ ] Load testing for concurrent user scenarios
- [ ] Automated test execution in development workflow
- [ ] Test reporting and coverage analysis

## Technical Implementation Details

### Testing Framework Setup
- **JUnit 5**: Primary testing framework for Java components
- **Spring Boot Test**: Integration testing with test slices
- **Testcontainers**: Database integration testing with real MySQL
- **MockMvc**: Controller layer testing with HTTP requests
- **AssertJ**: Fluent assertions for better test readability

### Unit Testing Strategy
- **Service Layer**: Business logic testing with mocked dependencies
- **Repository Layer**: Data access testing with test database
- **Entity Testing**: Validation and relationship testing
- **Utility Classes**: Helper method testing with edge cases
- **Security Components**: Authentication and authorization testing

### Integration Testing
- **Controller Tests**: Full HTTP request/response testing
- **Database Integration**: End-to-end database operations
- **Security Integration**: Authentication flow testing
- **API Testing**: RESTful endpoint validation
- **Error Handling**: Exception and error response testing

### Performance Testing
- **Load Testing**: Concurrent user simulation
- **Database Performance**: Query execution time validation
- **Page Load Testing**: Frontend performance measurement
- **Memory Usage**: Application resource consumption testing
- **Stress Testing**: System behavior under high load

### Quality Assurance
- **Code Coverage**: Minimum 80% coverage target
- **Static Analysis**: Code quality and security scanning
- **Test Documentation**: Clear test naming and documentation
- **Continuous Integration**: Automated test execution
- **Test Data Management**: Proper test data setup and cleanup

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Unit tests covering all business logic with edge cases
- [ ] Integration tests for all user workflows
- [ ] Security tests for authentication and authorization
- [ ] Performance tests meeting specified benchmarks (< 2s page load, < 500ms DB queries)
- [ ] Cross-browser testing on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- [ ] Mobile testing on various screen sizes (320px+)
- [ ] Load testing for 100+ concurrent users
- [ ] Regression testing for bug fixes and new features
- [ ] Test automation integrated into development workflow
- [ ] Test reporting with clear pass/fail criteria

## Definition of Done

- Comprehensive test suite covering all application functionality
- Code coverage target of 80% achieved and maintained
- All performance benchmarks met through testing
- Security testing validates protection against common vulnerabilities
- Cross-browser and mobile compatibility verified
- Load testing confirms concurrent user capacity
