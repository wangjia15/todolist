# Epic: todo-list

## Overview
A multi-user todo list management system built with Spring Boot 3.x, MySQL, and shadcn/ui components. The system focuses on secure user authentication, complete data isolation between users, and responsive CRUD operations for task management with priority and due date features.

## Architecture Decisions
- **Backend Framework**: Spring Boot 3.x with Java 17 for modern development practices
- **Database**: MySQL with MyBatis-Plus for efficient ORM and query optimization
- **Frontend**: Thymeleaf templates integrated with shadcn/ui components for modern, responsive design
- **Authentication**: Session-based authentication using Spring Security (not JWT for MVP simplicity)
- **Security**: BCrypt password hashing with proper session management
- **Database Design**: User isolation through foreign key relationships ensuring complete data separation

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components
- Responsive layout using shadcn/ui design system
- Task list component with filtering and sorting capabilities
- Task creation/editing forms with validation
- Priority and due date picker components
- Mobile-first responsive design for 320px+ screens
- Accessible UI components following WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines

### Backend Services
- **User Management Service**: Registration, login, logout, session handling
- **Task Management Service**: CRUD operations with user isolation
- **Authentication Controller**: Secure login/logout endpoints
- **Task Controller**: RESTful endpoints for task operations
- **Data Models**: User, Task entities with proper relationships
- **Validation**: Input sanitization and business rule validation

### Infrastructure
- Embedded Tomcat server for development and deployment
- MySQL database with connection pooling
- Session storage for authentication state
- Logging and monitoring setup
- Production-ready configuration for single server deployment

## Implementation Strategy
- **Phase 1**: Core authentication and basic task CRUD (Week 1)
- **Phase 2**: Task organization features - priority, due dates, filtering (Week 2)
- **Phase 3**: Enhanced UI/UX and mobile optimization (Week 3)
- **Phase 4**: Performance optimization and comprehensive testing (Week 4)
- **Risk Mitigation**: Focus on data security and user isolation from day one
- **Testing Approach**: Unit tests for services, integration tests for controllers, manual testing for UI

## Task Summary
Epic decomposed into 9 individual tasks covering all critical development areas:

- **001**: Database Schema & Configuration Setup (8 hours) - MySQL setup, entity relationships, user isolation
- **002**: User Authentication System Implementation (10 hours) - Spring Security, registration, login/logout
- **003**: Core Task CRUD Operations with User Isolation (12 hours) - Full task management with security
- **004**: Task Organization Features (8 hours) - Priority levels, due dates, filtering, sorting
- **005**: Frontend UI Implementation with shadcn/ui (14 hours) - Responsive UI, accessibility, mobile design
- **006**: Security & Validation Implementation (6 hours) - Input validation, XSS/CSRF protection
- **007**: Testing & Quality Assurance (10 hours) - Unit/integration tests, performance testing
- **008**: Performance Optimization (6 hours) - Database optimization, caching, load testing
- **009**: Deployment Configuration & Production Setup (4 hours) - Production config, monitoring

**Total Estimated Effort**: 78 hours across 9 tasks
**Critical Path**: 001 → 002 → 003 → 005 (UI depends on core functionality)
**Parallel Work**: Tasks 004, 006, 007, 008 can be worked on in parallel after core tasks complete

## Dependencies
- **External Dependencies**: Java 17 runtime, MySQL server, Maven build system
- **Framework Dependencies**: Spring Boot 3.x, Spring Security, Thymeleaf, MyBatis-Plus
- **UI Dependencies**: shadcn/ui components, responsive design frameworks
- **Development Dependencies**: Lombok, Jakarta Validation, testing frameworks
- **Infrastructure Dependencies**: Web server configuration, database connectivity

## Success Criteria (Technical)
- **Performance**: Page loads < 2 seconds, database queries < 500ms response time
- **Security**: Complete user data isolation, secure password hashing, session management
- **Scalability**: Support for 100+ concurrent users with horizontal scaling capability
- **Quality**: < 1% error rate, comprehensive test coverage, cross-browser compatibility
- **Mobile**: Functional responsive design on 320px+ width devices
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for core user workflows

## Estimated Effort
- **Overall Timeline**: 4 weeks for MVP completion
- **Resource Requirements**: 1-2 full-stack developers
- **Critical Path**: Authentication system → Task CRUD → UI implementation → Testing
- **Development Hours**: ~120-160 hours total (30-40 hours per week)
- **Risk Buffer**: 20% additional time for integration issues and testing
