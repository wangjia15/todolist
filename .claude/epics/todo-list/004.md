# Task 004: Task Organization Features (Priority, Due Dates, Filtering)

## Description

Enhance the task management system with organizational features including priority levels, due date management, task filtering by status, and sorting capabilities. These features improve user productivity by enabling better task organization and prioritization.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Priority levels implemented (Low, Medium, High) with visual indicators
- [ ] Due date assignment and editing functionality
- [ ] Task filtering by completion status (All, Pending, Completed)
- [ ] Task sorting by creation date, due date, and priority
- [ ] Overdue task identification and visual indicators
- [ ] Priority-based task ordering in lists
- [ ] Due date validation (cannot be in the past)
- [ ] Filter persistence across user sessions
- [ ] Clear and intuitive filter/sort UI controls
- [ ] Performance optimization for filtered and sorted queries

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Enhancements
- **Priority Enum**: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH priority levels in database
- **Due Date Field**: DATETIME field with proper indexing
- **Database Indexes**: Composite indexes for priority + due_date + user_id
- **Query Optimization**: Efficient filtering and sorting queries

### Backend Enhancements
- **TaskService Updates**: Methods for filtering and sorting
- **Priority Management**: Enum handling and validation
- **Due Date Logic**: Validation and overdue calculation
- **Query Builder**: Dynamic query construction for filters
- **Response DTOs**: Enhanced responses with priority and due date info

### Controller Enhancements
- **Filter Parameters**: Query parameters for status, priority, sort order
- **Validation**: Due date and priority validation
- **Response Format**: Consistent response structure with filtering metadata
- **Error Handling**: Proper error messages for invalid filters

### Business Logic
- **Overdue Detection**: Logic to identify and flag overdue tasks
- **Default Sorting**: Sensible default sort order (priority + due date)
- **Filter Combinations**: Support for multiple simultaneous filters
- **Validation Rules**: Business rules for due dates and priorities

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Unit tests for priority and due date validation
- [ ] Integration tests for filtering and sorting endpoints
- [ ] Performance tests for complex filtered queries
- [ ] Edge case tests (overdue tasks, null due dates)
- [ ] Sorting accuracy tests across different criteria
- [ ] Filter combination tests for expected results
- [ ] Database index performance verification
- [ ] User experience tests for filter persistence

## Definition of Done

- All organization features working correctly and intuitively
- Filter and sort operations perform within acceptable time limits
- Priority and due date features fully integrated with task CRUD
- Overdue task detection working accurately
- Database queries optimized for filtering and sorting
- User interface properly reflects organizational features
- All tests passing with good coverage
