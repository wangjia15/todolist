# Task 006: Security & Validation Implementation

## Description

Implement comprehensive security measures and input validation across the application to protect against common security vulnerabilities, ensure data integrity, and provide robust input sanitization. This task strengthens the application's security posture and validates all user inputs.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Server-side input validation for all forms and API endpoints
- [ ] XSS protection through proper input sanitization and output encoding
- [ ] SQL injection prevention verified through parameterized queries
- [ ] CSRF protection enabled and properly configured
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented for authentication endpoints
- [ ] Security headers configured (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- [ ] Input length limits and data type validation
- [ ] File upload security (if applicable)
- [ ] Session security hardening (secure cookies, session fixation protection)
- [ ] Error message sanitization to prevent information disclosure

## Technical Implementation Details

### Input Validation
- **Bean Validation**: Jakarta Validation annotations on DTOs and entities
- **Custom Validators**: Business rule validation for complex scenarios
- **Sanitization**: HTML input sanitization using OWASP Java HTML Sanitizer
- **Length Limits**: Appropriate field length restrictions
- **Data Type Validation**: Proper validation for dates, emails, priorities

### Security Configuration
- **Spring Security**: Enhanced security configuration with proper headers
- **CSRF Protection**: Token-based CSRF protection for all forms
- **Session Security**: Secure session configuration and cookie settings
- **Password Security**: Strong password requirements and BCrypt configuration
- **Rate Limiting**: Basic rate limiting for sensitive endpoints

### Security Headers
- **Content Security Policy**: Strict CSP to prevent XSS attacks
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevent clickjacking attacks
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevent MIME type sniffing
- **Strict-Transport-Security**: HTTPS enforcement (for production)
- **Referrer-Policy**: Control referrer information leakage

### Error Handling
- **Information Disclosure**: Sanitized error messages for production
- **Logging**: Security event logging for monitoring
- **Exception Handling**: Global exception handler with security considerations
- **Validation Messages**: Clear but secure validation error messages

### Data Protection
- **Input Sanitization**: Clean all user inputs before processing
- **Output Encoding**: Proper encoding for different contexts (HTML, JavaScript)
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: MyBatis-Plus parameterized queries verification
- **Authentication Guards**: Ensure all endpoints properly protected

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Security penetration testing for common vulnerabilities
- [ ] Input validation testing with malicious inputs and edge cases
- [ ] XSS testing with various attack vectors
- [ ] SQL injection testing on all database interactions
- [ ] CSRF protection testing with token manipulation
- [ ] Rate limiting testing for authentication endpoints
- [ ] Session security testing (hijacking, fixation)
- [ ] Security header validation using security scanners

## Definition of Done

- All security measures implemented and thoroughly tested
- Input validation working correctly for all user inputs
- Security vulnerabilities identified and mitigated
- Security headers properly configured and verified
- Rate limiting and authentication protection working
- Security testing passed with no critical vulnerabilities
- Security documentation updated with implemented measures
- Code review completed focusing on security aspects
