# Task 003: Core Task CRUD Operations with User Isolation

## Description

Implement the core task management functionality including Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations with strict user data isolation. This task provides the fundamental task management capabilities that form the backbone of the todo-list application.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create task endpoint with title (required) and description (optional)
- [ ] Read task list endpoint with user isolation and pagination
- [ ] Update task endpoint for editing title, description, and completion status
- [ ] Soft delete task endpoint with confirmation
- [ ] Task retrieval filtered by authenticated user only
- [ ] Input validation for all task operations
- [ ] Error handling for all CRUD operations
- [ ] Automatic timestamp management (created_at, updated_at)
- [ ] Task completion toggle functionality
- [ ] Proper response codes and error messages

## Technical Implementation Details

### Controller Layer
- **TaskController**: RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations
- **Request/Response DTOs**: Data transfer objects for API communication
- **Validation Annotations**: Jakarta Validation for input validation
- **Error Handling**: Global exception handler for consistent error responses
- **Security**: Ensure user context in all operations

### Service Layer
- **TaskService**: Business logic for task operations
- **User Context**: Authentication-based user identification
- **Data Validation**: Business rule validation and data integrity
- **Transaction Management**: Proper transaction boundaries for operations
- **Audit Trail**: Automatic timestamp and user tracking

### Repository Layer
- **TaskRepository**: MyBatis-Plus repository with custom queries
- **User Isolation**: All queries filtered by user_id
- **Soft Delete**: Implementation of logical deletion
- **Pagination**: Support for large task lists
- **Optimized Queries**: Efficient database operations

### Data Transfer Objects
- **CreateTaskRequest**: Validation for task creation
- **UpdateTaskRequest**: Validation for task updates
- **TaskResponse**: Standardized task response format
- **TaskListResponse**: Paginated task list with metadata

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Unit tests for TaskService with user isolation verification
- [ ] Integration tests for all CRUD endpoints
- [ ] Security tests ensuring users can only access their own tasks
- [ ] Validation tests for input constraints and edge cases
- [ ] Performance tests for large task lists and pagination
- [ ] Concurrency tests for simultaneous task operations
- [ ] Error handling tests for various failure scenarios
- [ ] Database transaction tests for data consistency

## Definition of Done

- All CRUD operations working correctly with user isolation
- Comprehensive input validation and error handling implemented
- Performance targets met for task operations (< 500ms)
- All security requirements verified through testing
- Database operations properly tested and optimized
- API documentation updated with endpoint specifications
- Code coverage meets quality standards
